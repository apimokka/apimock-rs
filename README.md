## üõ†Ô∏è App overhaul announcement

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Major update in development (v4)

v4 introduces a fundamental shift in design. Existing configuration files will no longer work as-is. Some features will be deprecated.
In return: cleaner configs, dynamic resolution, and better extensibility.

Notice below is around v4 and current stable version is [v3](https://github.com/nabbisen/apimock-rs/tree/3.2.2).

## ü™Ñ Mock APIs easily ‚Äî no setup stress, just JSON and go

If you‚Äôre building or testing APIs, this tool makes mocking painless. You don‚Äôt need to write any config files ‚Äî just use folders and JSON. It‚Äôs super fast, efficient, and flexible when you need it to be.

    üéà No config needed to get started

    ü•∑ Fast to launch, light on memory, out of your way

    üß© Moreover, advanced matching and custom scripting supported

It‚Äôs rebuilt from the ground up in version 4. Designed to help developers of all levels.

![demo](docs/.assets/demo.gif)

```sh
# install
npm install -D apimock-rs
# and go
npx apimock
```

```sh
# just use folders and JSON
mkdir -p api/v1/
echo '{"hello": "world"}' > api/v1/hello.json
npx apimock

# response
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/hello
# --> {"hello":"world"}
```

```sh
# also, there's room to tweak things later
npx apimock --init
```
