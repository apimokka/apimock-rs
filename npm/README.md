# API Mock (apimock-rs)

## ðŸª„ Mock APIs easily â€” no setup stress, just JSON and go

If youâ€™re building or testing APIs, this tool makes mocking painless. You donâ€™t need to write any config files â€” just use folders and JSON. Itâ€™s super fast, efficient, and flexible when you need it to be.

    ðŸŽˆ No config needed to get started

    ðŸ¥· Fast to launch, light on memory, out of your way

    ðŸ§© Moreover, advanced matching and custom scripting supported

Itâ€™s rebuilt from the ground up in version 4. Designed to help developers of all levels.

![demo](https://github.com/apimokka/apimock-rs/blob/main/docs/.assets/demo.gif?raw=true)

```sh
# install
npm install -D apimock-rs
# and go
npx apimock
```

```sh
# just use folders and JSON
mkdir -p api/v1/
echo '{"hello": "world"}' > api/v1/hello.json
npx apimock

# response
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/hello
# --> {"hello":"world"}
```

```sh
# also, there's room to tweak things later
npx apimock --init
```
